;; Welcome, friend. **clerk.garden** is a simple publishing space for Clerk notebooks.
;; Here is how it works:

;; ## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add a `:nextjournal/clerk` alias to your `deps.edn` file.
;; It must contain, at least, the following values:

(clerk/html
  {::clerk/width :wide}
  [:div.viewer.viewer-code.not-prose
   (clerk/code "{:deps ,,,
:aliases
{:nextjournal/clerk
 {:exec-fn nextjournal.clerk/build-static-app!
  :exec-args {:paths [\"src/nextjournal/garden/ui/builder.clj\"
                      ;; TODO: add all notebooks you want to have built here
                      ]}}})")])

;; ## 2Ô∏è‚É£  Try it out locally to make sure it works
;; Entering the following command into your Terminal should build your notebooks and open an
;; index page in your browser.

(clerk/html
  {::clerk/width :wide}
  [:div.viewer.viewer-code.not-prose
   (clerk/code "clj -X:nextjournal/clerk")])
